## ⚙️ Steps in the Project

### 1. **Data Loading & Exploration (EDA)**

* Import dataset using Python (`pandas.read_csv()`).
* Perform exploratory data analysis: missing values, outliers, distributions, and correlations.
* Visualize trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

### 2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**

* Handle missing data, duplicates, and incorrect data types.
* Normalize or encode categorical variables where needed.
* Save cleaned dataset as a new file for SQL and visualization stages.

### 3. **SQL Analysis**

* Load cleaned data into PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server.
* Run analytical SQL queries (joins, aggregations, subqueries, window functions).
* Extract key business insights (e.g., customer segmentation, revenue trends).

### 4. **Dashboard Creation (Power BI)**

* Connect Power BI to the SQL database or cleaned CSV.
* Create interactive dashboards with KPIs, charts, and filters.
* Include visuals such as sales by region, top-performing products, and customer trends.

### 5. **Report Writing**

* Summarize analysis process, key insights, and recommendations in a clear report format.
* Include visual snapshots from Power BI dashboard.

### 6. **Presentation (Gamma)**

* Build a modern, data-driven presentation using Gamma.
* Highlight business impact, findings, and actionable recommendations.
